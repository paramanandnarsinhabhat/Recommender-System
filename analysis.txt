Executive Summary: Collaborative Filtering Model Comparison

The criterion for our evaluation was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which measures the accuracy of predictions made by each model. 
A lower RMSE is indicative of a model's superior ability to forecast user preferences accurately.

The performance of the models is summarized below:

- Matrix-Based Collaborative Filtering: RMSE = 0.9135
- Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (Weighted Mean Model): RMSE = 1.0316
- Mean Model:** RMSE = 1.0420
- User-Based Collaborative Filtering: RMSE = 1.0950

It is evident from our analysis that the Matrix-Based Collaborative Filtering model demonstrates a remarkable prediction precision, with the lowest RMSE of 0.9135. This model's predictive accuracy surpassed that of the traditional user-based and item-based methods.
